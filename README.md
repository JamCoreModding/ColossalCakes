**Important Note:** this mod was created for a ModFest in 1 week, which I was not around for much of. The code is
somewhat rushed together, and some bugs have been fixed with shortcuts to ensure the mod was finished in time. I likely
won't work on this mod after the fest, and as such I don't recommend you use this in a survival world.

## Usage

All recipes are available through EMI.

To make a cake, get a collection of cakes block and place them together, then right click one of them with a rolling
pin.
